# Centralized Aprroach for Entra Authentication

Replacing the standard WordPress authentication with Azure AD B2C authentication involves several steps, and there are considerations to keep in mind. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Plugin Activation**:
   - When your plugin is activated, you should check if the necessary Azure AD B2C settings (like client ID, tenant ID, etc.) are set. If not, prompt the site admin to configure them.

2. **Override the Default Login**:
   - Use the `authenticate` filter hook in WordPress to override the default authentication mechanism.
   - When a user tries to log in, instead of checking the WordPress database, redirect them to the Azure AD B2C login page.
   - After successful authentication with Azure AD B2C, the user will be redirected back to your callback endpoint, where you can set the WordPress user session.

3. **User Creation & Matching**:
   - When a user logs in via Azure AD B2C for the first time, you can choose to automatically create a new user in the WordPress database.
   - For subsequent logins, match the Azure AD B2C user with the WordPress user using a unique identifier (like email or a custom user ID).
   - Store Azure AD B2C user attributes (like `oid`) as user meta in WordPress to help with matching.

4. **Existing Users**:
   - For users already registered in WordPress (like the admin), you have a few options:
     - **Manual Migration**: Manually create these users in Azure AD B2C.
     - **Automatic Migration**: Implement a "just-in-time" migration. The first time an existing WordPress user logs in, if they don't exist in Azure AD B2C, create them automatically.
     - **Dual Authentication**: Allow both Azure AD B2C and standard WordPress authentication. This can be a temporary measure during the transition phase.

5. **Role Mapping**:
   - Map Azure AD B2C roles/groups to WordPress roles. For instance, if a user is part of an "Admin" group in Azure AD B2C, assign them the "Administrator" role in WordPress.

6. **Logout**:
   - Ensure that logging out from WordPress also logs the user out of Azure AD B2C, or vice versa, based on your requirements.

7. **Password Reset & Profile Updates**:
   - Redirect WordPress's default "Lost your password?" and profile update functionalities to Azure AD B2C.

8. **Fallback & Recovery**:
   - Always have a fallback mechanism. For instance, allow the site admin to disable Azure AD B2C authentication in case of issues.
   - Consider having a secret URL or method to log in using standard WordPress authentication, especially for admin users.

9. **Security Considerations**:
   - Ensure that the OAuth 2.0 `state` parameter is used to prevent CSRF attacks.
   - Validate ID tokens and ensure they are issued by the expected Azure AD B2C tenant.

10. **User Experience**:

- Customize the Azure AD B2C login page to match your WordPress site's look and feel for a consistent user experience.

In summary, while integrating Azure AD B2C with WordPress, you can choose to completely replace the standard WordPress authentication or allow both methods to coexist for a period. Existing users can be migrated manually, automatically, or allowed to use both authentication methods. Always ensure that there's a fallback mechanism and prioritize security in all steps.
